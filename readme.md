LinuxJumpstart
==============

A tutorial series covering Linux kernel topics, starting
with beginner-level examples.

Tutorials
---------

Current tutorials:

* [Echo Kernel Module](ekm/readme.md): A simple character
  device driver

AI-Assisted Development
-----------------------

This project experiments with AI-assisted code generation
using tools like:

* [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai)
* [Cursor: The AI Code Editor](https://www.cursor.com/)
* [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)

Our goal is to explore how AI can help developers create
robust, high-performance, and easily understood code more
efficiently.

Note: While AI tools are used in the development process,
all code is reviewed and tested by human developers to
ensure quality and correctness.

Development Status
------------------

LinuxJumpstart is under active development. Additional
tutorials are planned to cover more advanced topics in
Linux kernel programming.
